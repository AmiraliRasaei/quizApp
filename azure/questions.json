One of the settings that can be managed with this cmdlet is the ability to enable or disable self-service sign-up for users.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings</strong>:<ul><li>This cmdlet is used to configure federation settings for a domain in Azure AD, typically when setting up federated identity management with on-premises Active Directory.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Update-MsolFederatedDomain</strong>:<ul><li>This cmdlet is used to update the settings for a federated domain in Azure AD, often used when changes are made to the on-premises federation settings that need to be reflected in Azure AD.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Set-MsolDomain</strong>:<ul><li>This cmdlet is used to configure domain settings in Azure AD, such as verifying and configuring domains for the organization.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Why Option A is Correct</h3><p>To prevent users from creating user accounts via self-service sign-up using their contoso.com email address, we need to modify the settings that control self-service sign-up capabilities at the company level. The appropriate cmdlet for managing company-level settings, including enabling or disabling self-service sign-up, is <strong>Set-MsolCompanySettings</strong>.</p><h3>Example of How to Use Set-MsolCompanySettings</h3><p>The specific setting to disable self-service sign-up is the <strong>AllowAdHocSubscriptions</strong> parameter. To disable self-service sign-up, you would run the following PowerShell command:</p><pre><code>Set-MsolCompanySettings -AllowAdHocSubscriptions $false</code></pre><p>This command disables the ability for users to sign up for Azure AD or Microsoft 365 services using their organization's email address without administrative approval.</p><h3>Summary</h3><ul><li><strong>Set-MsolCompanySettings</strong> is used to manage settings at the company level in Azure AD.</li><li>The <strong>AllowAdHocSubscriptions</strong> parameter controls the ability for self-service sign-up.</li><li>By setting <strong>AllowAdHocSubscriptions</strong> to <strong>$false</strong>, you can prevent users from creating accounts using self-service sign-up.</li></ul><p>Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:</p><p><strong>A.

Fabrikam has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named fabrikam.com.<br>Existing Environment.

Only the Contoso_Resources OU is synced.<br>Helpdesk administrators routinely use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage user settings.<br>User administrators currently use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manually assign licenses. All users have all licenses assigned besides the following exceptions:<br>• The users in the London office have the Microsoft 365 Phone System license unassigned.<br>• The users in the Seattle office have the Yammer Enterprise license unassigned.<br>Security defaults are disabled for contoso.com.<br>Contoso uses Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to protect administrative roles.<br>Existing Environment. Problem Statements<br>Contoso identifies the following issues:<br>• Currently, all the helpdesk administrators can manage user licenses throughout the entire Microsoft 365 tenant.<br>• The user administrators report that it is tedious to manually configure the different license requirements for each Contoso office.<br>• The helpdesk administrators spend too much time provisioning internal and guest access to the required Microsoft 365 services and apps.<br>• Currently, the helpdesk administrators can perform tasks by using the User administrator role without justification or approval.<br>• When the Logs node is selected in Azure AD, an error message appears stating that Log Analytics integration is not enabled.<br>Requirements. Planned Changes<br>Contoso plans to implement the following changes:<br>• Implement self-service password reset (SSPR).<br>• Analyze Azure audit activity logs by using Azure Monitor.<br>• Simplify license allocation for new users added to the tenant.<br>• Collaborate with the users at Fabrikam on a joint marketing campaign.<br>• Configure the User administrator role to require justification and approval to activate.<br>• Implement a custom line-of-business Azure web app named App1. App1 will be accessible from the internet and authenticated by using Azure AD accounts.<br>• For new users in the marketing department, implement an automated approval workflow to provide access to a Microsoft SharePoint Online site, group, and app.<br>Contoso plans to acquire a company named ADatum Corporation.

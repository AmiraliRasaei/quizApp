One of the settings that can be managed with this cmdlet is the ability to enable or disable self-service sign-up for users.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings</strong>:<ul><li>This cmdlet is used to configure federation settings for a domain in Azure AD, typically when setting up federated identity management with on-premises Active Directory.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Update-MsolFederatedDomain</strong>:<ul><li>This cmdlet is used to update the settings for a federated domain in Azure AD, often used when changes are made to the on-premises federation settings that need to be reflected in Azure AD.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Set-MsolDomain</strong>:<ul><li>This cmdlet is used to configure domain settings in Azure AD, such as verifying and configuring domains for the organization.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Why Option A is Correct</h3><p>To prevent users from creating user accounts via self-service sign-up using their contoso.com email address, we need to modify the settings that control self-service sign-up capabilities at the company level. The appropriate cmdlet for managing company-level settings, including enabling or disabling self-service sign-up, is <strong>Set-MsolCompanySettings</strong>.</p><h3>Example of How to Use Set-MsolCompanySettings</h3><p>The specific setting to disable self-service sign-up is the <strong>AllowAdHocSubscriptions</strong> parameter. To disable self-service sign-up, you would run the following PowerShell command:</p><pre><code>Set-MsolCompanySettings -AllowAdHocSubscriptions $false</code></pre><p>This command disables the ability for users to sign up for Azure AD or Microsoft 365 services using their organization's email address without administrative approval.</p><h3>Summary</h3><ul><li><strong>Set-MsolCompanySettings</strong> is used to manage settings at the company level in Azure AD.</li><li>The <strong>AllowAdHocSubscriptions</strong> parameter controls the ability for self-service sign-up.</li><li>By setting <strong>AllowAdHocSubscriptions</strong> to <strong>$false</strong>, you can prevent users from creating accounts using self-service sign-up.</li></ul><p>Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:</p><p><strong>A.
